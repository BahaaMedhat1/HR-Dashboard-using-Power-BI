## **Project Overview**
This project involves an **HR Analytics Dashboard** developed in **Power BI** to analyze employee data, focusing on metrics such as attrition rates, employee demographics, satisfaction ratings, and departmental performance. The goal is to provide actionable insights to HR teams for strategic decision-making, particularly in addressing employee turnover.

## DAX Calculations
Here are some of the DAX calculations used in this project:
1. **Active Employees**
   ```DAX
   Active Employees = count('HR data'[emp no]) - 'DAX'[Attrition count]
   ```
   Calculates the total number of active employees by subtracting the attrition count from the total employee count.

2. **Attrition count**
   ```DAX
   Attrition count = countx(filter('HR data', 'HR data'[Attrition]="Yes"),'HR data'[Attrition])
   ```
   Counts the number of employees who have left the organization, based on the 'Attrition' column.

3. **Attrition Rate**
   ```DAX
   Attrition Rate = 'DAX'[Attrition count] / count('HR data'[emp no])  
   ```
   Calculates the attrition rate by dividing the attrition count by the total number of employees.

4. **Average Employee age**
   ```DAX
   Average Employee age = AVERAGE('HR data'[Age])
   ```
   Computes the average age of employees in the dataset.
